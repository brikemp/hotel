List of changes that I would like to make:
	- I would like to break apart my make_reservation class in to separate methods that are called my an “overall” make_reservation class. Currently, that class contains a lot of ifs/elses that make it confusing to follow and update when needed
	- I would like to combine my block and reservation classes into one because there are limited differences between the two and this sticks to single the single responsibility of making reservations for rooms
